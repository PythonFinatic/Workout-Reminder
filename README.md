# Workout-Reminder
This is basically a python application that reminds you everyday at a set time to workout,
but there's a twist. Whenever you try to exit, you can't! The program generates a random workout from a list,
determines whether you should do reps or have a set time for a workout (for example, you wouldn't have a set time for push-ups,
so the program would set it to reps), and once the time runs out, you may exit. You get 5 emergency exits per month. 
If you try to exit before you are done with the workout, however, you will see the screen again after exiting, 
but this time the reps/time is multiplied by 2! Please contribute.
